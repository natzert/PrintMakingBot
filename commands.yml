# Materials
"!materials":
  return: "Information on the materials used in the print making process can be found here: http://woodblock.com/encyclopedia/topics/toc_tools_and_materials.html"
"!wood":
  return: "Dave carves on cherry wood glued to a plywood core. Cherry is soft enough to easily carve yet still hard enough to be durable over multiple printings."
"!baren":
  return: "A baren is used to apply pressure to the paper when printing. It is made of woven bamboo cords coiled into a disc and wrapped in a thin bamboo sheath."
"!persuader":
  return: "Hold on to your butts"

# Process
"!info":
  return: "This is a channel about Japanese woodblock print making. Here is a video showing the entire process in a condensed format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w--FkyOuFQ"
"!registration":
  return: "Registration marks are used to maintain alignment during the printing process. There is a small 90 degree cutout on the bottom right of the block and another straight cutout on the bottom closer to the left side of the block."
"!key-block":
  return: "The basic outline of an image is printed using a key block. These blocks are typically printed using a black pigment."
"!color-block":
  return: "Color blocks are used to print a single color. If an image has 6 colors then 6 unique color blocks must be carved."
"!sizing":
  return: "Before the paper is prepared for printing it must be sized. A coat is added to the top side to allow the pigments to stick to the paper uniformly. Another is added to the back to protect the surface and facilitate the rubbing by the baren. Read more about this here: http://woodblock.com/encyclopedia/entries/016_02/016_02.html"
"!carve-depth":
  return: "Dave determines the depth to carve based on the distance between lines. If there are small gaps, the depth doesn't need to be deep, but if there are large gaps, he will carve a depth up to 4mm. This is to make sure the paper doesn't hit the base of the woodblock."
