# Materials
"!materials":
  return: "Information on the materials used in the print making process can be found here: http://woodblock.com/encyclopedia/topics/toc_tools_and_materials.html"
  limit: 10
"!wood":
  return: "Dave carves on cherry wood glued to a plywood core. Cherry is soft enough to easily carve yet still hard enough to be durable over multiple printings."
  limit: 10
"!pigment":
  return: "The printing is done using a mixture of powdered pigments, water, and alcohol."
  limit: 10
"!baren":
  return: "A baren is used to apply pressure to the paper when printing. It is made of woven bamboo cords coiled into a disc and wrapped in a thin bamboo sheath."
  limit: 10
"!water":
  return: "The flask of water helps to diffuse the light on Dave's working surface. It makes it easier to see what he is carving."

"!persuader":
  return: "Hold on to your butts."
  limit: 10
"!splinters":
  return: "Come on now. Dave is a professional. He doesn't get splinters."
  limit: 10
"!paste":
  return: "Rice paste is used on almost every impression of a print. Without it, the pigment mix is too watery and won't print smoothly. Paste is also used when printing the keyblock, albeit to a lesser extent, since too much paste on that block would cause it to fill up between places where the lines are close together."
  limit: 10
"!paper":
  return: "The paper Dave uses is called washi. It is made traditionally by hand using mulberry fibre."
  limit: 10
"!gampi":
  return: "Gampi paper is used to transfer the image to the block. Dave glues it to ordinary copy paper so it is sturdy enough to be passed through a laser printer."
  limit: 10

# Process
"!info":
  return: "This is a channel about Japanese woodblock print making. Here is a video showing the entire process in a condensed format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w--FkyOuFQ"
  limit: 10
"!registration":
  return: "Registration marks are used to maintain alignment during the printing process. There is a small 90 degree cutout on the bottom right of the block and another straight cutout on the bottom closer to the left side of the block."
  limit: 10
"!key-block":
  return: "The basic outline of an image is printed using a key block. These blocks are typically printed using a black pigment."
  limit: 10
"!color-block":
  return: "Color blocks are used to add color to a print. Each block can add one or more colors with each impression. Color blocks that overlap can layer pigments so that there are more colors in the final print than the number of blocks used."
  limit: 10
"!sizing":
  return: "Before the paper is prepared for printing it must be sized. A coat is added to the top side to allow the pigments to stick to the paper uniformly. Another is added to the back to protect the surface and facilitate the rubbing by the baren. Read more about this here: http://woodblock.com/encyclopedia/entries/016_02/016_02.html"
  limit: 10
"!carve-depth":
  return: "Dave determines the depth to carve based on the distance between lines. If there are small gaps, the depth doesn't need to be deep, but if there are large gaps, he will carve a depth up to 4mm. This is to make sure the paper doesn't hit the base of the woodblock."
  limit: 10
"!repair":
  return: "Dave often repairs nicks, dings, and cuts in the blocks. Here is a blog post detailing one such repair job: http://mokuhankan.com/conversations/archives/2017/01/a_new_hasui_print.html"
