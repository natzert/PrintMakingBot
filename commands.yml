# Materials
"!materials":
  return: "Information on the materials used in the print making process can be found here: http://woodblock.com/encyclopedia/topics/toc_tools_and_materials.html"
  limit: 10
"!wood":
  return: "Dave carves on cherry wood glued to a plywood core. Cherry is soft enough to easily carve yet still hard enough to be durable over multiple printings. Occasionally, for very detailed carving, Dave uses harder boxwood."
  limit: 10
"!pigment":
  return: "The printing is done using a mixture of powdered pigments, water, and alcohol."
  limit: 10
"!baren":
  return: "A baren is used to apply pressure to the paper when printing. It is made of woven bamboo cords coiled into a disc and wrapped in a thin bamboo sheath."
  limit: 10
"!water":
  return: "The flask of water helps to diffuse the light on Dave's working surface. It makes it easier to see what he is carving."
  limit: 10
"!persuader":
  return: "Hold on to your butts."
  limit: 10
"!splinters":
  return: "Come on now. Dave is a professional. He doesn't get splinters."
  limit: 10
"!paste":
  return: "Rice paste is used on almost every impression of a print. Without it, the pigment mix is too watery and won't print smoothly. Paste is also used when printing the keyblock, albeit to a lesser extent, since too much paste on that block would cause it to fill up between places where the lines are close together."
  limit: 10
"!paper":
  return: "The paper Dave uses is called washi. It is made traditionally by hand using mulberry fibre."
  limit: 10
"!gampi":
  return: "Gampi paper is used to transfer the image to the block. Dave glues it to ordinary copy paper so it is sturdy enough to be passed through a laser printer."
  limit: 10
"!nagura":
  return: "Before sharpening his blades, Dave likes to rub a nagura block on the sharpening stones. The slurry helps to create a better contact surface between the blade and sharpening stone."
  limit: 10
"!scope":
  return: "The scope is a Meiji EMZ5 binocular microscope, like those used to examine circuit boards. Dave uses an accessory lens that reduces the magnification by 0.5X (which also increases the field of view). The main effect is to bring the work closer to the eyes without having to slump over. Dave started using the scope while he was producing his 'Beauties of Four Season' series, to help with the fine hair carving, and hasn't looked back! (Not to mention that fact that in recent years his eyesight has begun to fail, and having the scope is going to extend his working career at least a few years, it seems.)"

# Process
"!info":
  return: "This is a channel about Japanese woodblock print making. Here is a video showing the entire process in a condensed format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w--FkyOuFQ"
  limit: 10
"!registration":
  return: "Registration marks are used to maintain alignment during the printing process. There is a small 90 degree cutout on the bottom right of the block and another straight cutout on the bottom closer to the left side of the block."
  limit: 10
"!key-block":
  return: "The basic outline of an image is printed using a key block. These blocks are typically printed using a black pigment."
  limit: 10
"!color-block":
  return: "Color blocks are used to add color to a print. Each block can add one or more colors with each impression. Color blocks that overlap can layer pigments so that there are more colors in the final print than the number of blocks used."
  limit: 10
"!sizing":
  return: "Before the paper is prepared for printing it must be sized. A coat is added to the top side to allow the pigments to stick to the paper uniformly. Another is added to the back to protect the surface and facilitate the rubbing by the baren. Read more about this here: http://woodblock.com/encyclopedia/entries/016_02/016_02.html"
  limit: 10
"!depth":
  return: "Dave determines the depth to carve based on the distance between lines. If there are small gaps, the depth doesn't need to be deep, but if there are large gaps, he will carve a depth up to 4mm. This is to make sure the paper doesn't touch the wrong part of the wood and get pigment where it should not."
  limit: 10
"!repair":
  return: "Dave often repairs nicks, dings, and cuts in the blocks. Here is a blog post detailing one such repair job: http://mokuhankan.com/conversations/archives/2017/01/a_new_hasui_print.html"
  limit: 10
"!embossing":
  return: "As the last step before preparing the prints for shipment, Dave embosses the names of the carver and printer into the white border. To do this he uses a polymer plate carrying the correct names combination that he orders from a regular print-shop. He moistens this area slightly for the embossing to work."
  limit: 10
"!sharpen":
  return: "Dave sharpens all of his tools himself almost daily. Sometimes he sharpens his knife on the stream."

"!sub":
  return: "Our main intention being here on Twitch is to let people see the printmaking, and to generally spread word about our work, not for funding. So at present, we haven't 'turned on' the affiliate or partner options that are available to us here. We (well, Dave) are having a ton of fun with this streaming, so please don't feel like you need to pay us for it - simply participate in the chats, and enjoy the companionship and discussions that we hope will come along!"

"!interns":
  return: "Dave doesn't offer internships/training, but occasionally he will allow someone who is already producing woodblock prints to work for a while in the Mokuhankan workshop."
  limit: 10
"!imperfect":
  return: "Mokuhankan does not sell or give away the prints that end up with defects. Neither the designer, the craftspeople, nor Dave himself wants those prints out in the world. This is the same as with any manufacturing business - a certain percentage of the products simply don't make it through all the way to the end. Don't lose any sleep over this, please."

# Japan
"!faces":
  return: "The pictures you see on the lampposts are old Japanese comedians who became famous while working in the theaters that were located along this street."

# Streams
"!streetcam":
  return: "The camera in the lower left corner shows the street in front of the shop. Sometimes it points east, toward Senso-ji Buddhist temple and Tokyo Skytree, and sometimes it points west, toward the Don Quijote store down the street."
  limit: 10
"!print-stream":
  return: "Printing is a little harder to do on-stream than carving, because timing is really important. The paper and block need to be at the optimal moisture content to achieve a good impression, and it's too easy while streaming to get distracted and let something dry out too much. That said, it does happen sometimes!"
